# onescpround
This is a plugin for SCP:SL which gives a round a chance to have a single type of SCP but multiple times.

# Config usage
`osr_round_chance`: Needs a number between `0.0` and `1.0`, determines how high the chance is of a OSR (One Scp Round) happening.
`osr_players_threshold`: Needs a number which determines how many players minimum are needed on the server for a OSR to happen.
`osr_scps_disallowed`: Expects the names of SCPs separated by comma's which you don't want for a OSR. SCP-079 and SCP-049-2 are excluded by default.
